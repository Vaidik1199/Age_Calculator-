# Age_Calculator-
This is my smaller project of python programming, in which we can find age not accurate but close to accurate.
Not such big achivement but ya we can predict the age without any live labrotary, we progrma the calender by itself creating the days, months, year without considering leap years and any other suspected activities that can affect the day or an hour. 
this is not that big achivement but ya as a beginner it would be great if he or she can make this type of project according to me because it takes a lot of time to use the idea or use the mind. it will really helpfull for logic building for newly begineer coders.
